      <p> Hello, this is simply dummy text of the printing ab  nd type
        <strong>is simply dummy text of</strong>
        <em>is simply dummy text of</em>
        setting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's
        standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown
        printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release
        of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions
         of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
