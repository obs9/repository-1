<p style="text-align: center;">There are many benefits to owning a pet. Including lowering blood pressure, social interaction, and the opportunity to form bonds. When I heard the Miami Dade Animal Adoption services were giving away cats for free, I knew it was time for me to save a furry animal and bring it into my home.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">However, the volunteers failed to mention some of the behaviours of a kitten that can take some getting used to. I have created a list:</p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;">
<tbody>
<tr style="height: 21px;">
<td style="width: 50%; height: 21px;">What I didn't know</td>
<td style="width: 50%; height: 21px;">What I know now</td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 21px;">
<td style="width: 50%; height: 21px;">Cats a cheaper than dogs to feed, but have trickier diets so table leftovers isn't an option.</td>
<td style="width: 50%; height: 21px;">Cats will ruin anything you remotely care about.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 21px;">
<td style="width: 50%; height: 21px;">Cats are bi-turnal and will wake you up in the wee hours of the morning to be fed.</td>
<td style="width: 50%; height: 21px;">Once you get a cat, you're going to want another one.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 21px;">
<td style="width: 50%; height: 21px;">Cats most often kneed and scratch things when they need their claws trimmed. Cats will always fight you on this.</td>
<td style="width: 50%; height: 21px;">Cats are easier to sneak on flights for free than dogs.</td>
</tr>
<tr style="height: 21px;">
<td style="width: 50%; height: 21px;">Cats don't need toys. Just give them a paper box or a plastic bag or some string and they'll go crazy.</td>
<td style="width: 50%; height: 21px;">Cats will try to sleep in any small space including the dryer.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
